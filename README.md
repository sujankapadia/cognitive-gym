# Cognitive Workout

A personal cognitive training application based on the "Three Pillars of Thinking" framework.

## Overview

The Cognitive Workout helps you develop three fundamental thinking skills:

1. **Observation** - Seeing reality clearly without ego filters
2. **Reasoning** - Connecting ideas logically and building strong arguments
3. **Reflection** - Evaluating actions and locking in improvements

## Getting Started

Simply open `cognitive-gym.html` in your web browser. No installation or build process required.

The application runs entirely offline and stores your training data locally in your browser's localStorage.

## Features

### Observation Tools
- **Reality Snapshot** - Record objective observations without interpretation
- **Story vs Reality** - Separate facts from emotional narratives

### Reasoning Tools
